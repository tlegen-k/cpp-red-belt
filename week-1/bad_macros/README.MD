## C++ Red belt
This repository contains my solutions to tasks from week 1 of [C++ course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/c-plus-plus-red/)

### Bad Macros

You are given a macro that prints the two values passed to it into the given output stream. There is a flaw in the implementation of the macro that limits its applicability in real programs. You need to find and fix the flaw.
```cpp
#define PRINT_VALUES(out, x, y) out << (x) << endl; out << (y) << endl
```
